# YOLOv8 Lane Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a lane detection system using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. The system detects road lanes and can be used in autonomous driving and driver assistance systems.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- Google Colab  

## 📂 Dataset
A road lane dataset was used for training and testing the model.

## 🧠 Model Description
YOLOv8 was used for object detection and lane detection using deep learning techniques.

## 📊 Results
The model successfully detected lanes under different road conditions. Sample output images are included in this repository.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Detect dashed and solid lane markings  
- Integrate obstacle and vehicle detection  
- Deploy on Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano  
- Improve performance in night and fog conditions
